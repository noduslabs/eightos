The action of every agent <br />
     into the world <br />
starts <br />
    from their physical selves. <br />
<br />
This section is comprised of the <br />
    settings<br />
    and implementation sequences<br />
based on ∞OS operating system<br />
to render one <br />
    fully prepared <br />
to intra&sim;act <br />
    with the Other,<br />
    with oneself, <br />
    with each and every one, <br />
    and with the totality.<br />
<br />
We start from the right pre&sim;sets<br />
    // bodymind dynamic form, <br />
    followed by techniques <br />
    of encounter and adaptation.<br />
<br />
Initiation starts with oneself <br />
    and then proceeds <br />
        to the social level. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
[0] Initial Set&sim;up<br />
A special agent understands, <br />
    that it is impossible to live <br />
without getting affected or hit.<br />
    // in one way or another<br />
Any disturbance within a medium –<br />
    stress, attack, punch, accident <br />
        may affect the agent.<br />
If there are no procedures <br />
    to release the tensions <br />
that are obtained over time, <br />
the agent accumulates those tensions <br />
    in the bodymind <br />
// traumas, complexes, unfulfilled gestalts, sankaras<br />
which then transform the psyche, the body, the intellect, <br />
    accumulating mutations along the way. <br />
The agents do not want to be mutants.<br />
The agents just want to be <br />
    closer to themselves, <br />
    but their experience of themselves <br />
    is ready for trans&sim;formations <br />
        and trance&sim;formations.<br />
Therefore, <br />
    it is important to know <br />
how to receive the external shock <br />
    and how to deal with it, <br />
maintaining a certain degree of <br />
    relaxation,  // tension only where it is needed <br />
    state&sim;form con&sim;dition <br />
    // condicere ‘agree upon’, agreement between parts<br />
    attentivity  // at&sim;tention<br />
    sensitivity, resilience,  <br />
    fluency, flexibility // fluidity<br />
<br />
[1] Neutralization Pre&sim;set<br />
In order to be fully <br />
    open and sensitive <br />
and to increase the adaptive capacities <br />
    of the body,  <br />
it’s necessary to neutralize <br />
    all the existing tensions <br />
within bodymind:<br />
set all the faders and all the toggles <br />
to their central position  <br />
￼<br />
<br />
any habitual tensions that exist within your body/mind should be set to minimum <br />
and even better to zero.<br />
// symmetry of the bodymind state&sim;form con&sim;dition<br />
there is only here, now, and the force of gravity. everything else is non&sim;existent.<br />
#con&sim;dition #sensitivity #align&sim;ment<br />
// sensation of hanging from upside down<br />
any habitual patterns, expressions, <br />
tensions, compensations, complexes <br />
are disposed of as they are not needed.<br />
<br />
￼<br />
￼<br />
The state is achieved through <br />
        continuous scan of the body <br />
                from top to bottom, from bottom to top,<br />
        aligning each part of the body <br />
                along the vertical axis of gravity / spine.<br />
<br />
[2] Metastability Pre&sim;set<br />
Metastable state [M] – ∞ – <br />
    dynamic non-equilibrium stability: <br />
        stability is maintained <br />
              while dis&sim;turbances are relatively small.<br />
/* unstable transitionary state [T] – stability is disrupted <br />
    even when the dis&sim;turbances are relatively small – <br />
    nervousness, fear, aggression, exciteability<br />
    stable state [S] – stability is maintained <br />
    even when the dis&sim;turbances are relatively big – <br />
    stubbornness, laziness, rigidity, comfort */<br />
To increase adaptative capacities,  <br />
    it is recommended to set the system <br />
         into Metastable state [M]<br />
￼<br />
// in order to be prepared<br />
Special agents do not patiently suffer, <br />
    nor do they live in their comfort zone [S].<br />
Special agent can only rest, <br />
    observing whatever it is that is happening [M];<br />
Special agents are prepared for changes, <br />
    to move along a more or less constant, <br />
and yet changing trajectory: <br />
    strange attractor, <br />
    metastable chaotic behavior.<br />
￼<br />
/* but not constant movement towards somewhere [T]<br />
    perpetual transitionary state, Transnomia;<br />
    a symptom called liquid modernity, brought with <br />
    the neoliberal state of things; constant search <br />
    for the new, easy excitement, constant anxiety, <br />
    superficiality */<br />

Liquid Modernity <br />

<br />
#fluidity #fluency #relaxation #connectedness<br />
In order to achieve metastable state&sim;form, <br />
    and maximize their adaptive capacities <br />
the agents should establish <br />
    several interacting rhythm&sim;loops <br />
    in their body/form <br />
Those parallel processes <br />
    will keep each other in check <br />
and can bring the system back <br />
    to the state of non-equilibrium stablity <br />
when one of the processes goes astray. <br />
￼<br />
<br />
we can relate this to the notion of homeostasis – small deviations from stability are regulated through various substances released to bring it to the stable state. if the deviations are too big, the organism shifts to a new state.<br />
<br />
<br />
The following preset combination is recommended <br />
     to achieve metastable state:   <br />
set your attention to the area of your nutro 2 cm below navel<br />
set your breathing to a stable constant rhythm, inhaling into the area designated above, activating the gut neurons <br />
let every inhalation spread to the whole [body sphere] for full activation of all body parts and the immediate surrounding.<br />
imagine a wave that is spreading through the whole body: starting from nutro towards the top then bottom, following a closed trajectory (nutro – spine – head)<br />
connect the breathing rhythm to internal count and movement (for example, steps or heartbeat) for internal phase&sim;beat synchronization<br />
￼<br />
set internal rotation following ∞ trajectory (horizontal 8), in the area of nutro (visible or invisible). sync the rotation with breathing.<br />
(part of trajectory inhale, part – exhale)<br />
/* for example: right forward, right backwards, <br />
    left forward, left backwards, right forward, etc. */<br />
<br />
￼<br />
pendulum breathing and movement: <br />
phases of movement are in sync with the phases of breathing (the breathing rhythm is leading the movement)<br />
breathing in motion – in order to increase elasticity of breathing and nervous system: inhale on 1 step, exhale on 1 step (inhaling through nose, exhaling through mouth). inhale on 2 steps, exhaling on 2 steps... and so on until 10, then “de-escalate” down to 1. <br />
further – continue walking but counting inside (not with the steps), moving the speed and velocity of your movement, stopping sometimes, making sure the breathing rate stays the same (2-3 counts inhale, 2-3 counts exhale)<br />
<br />
<br />
[3] Assimilation, En&sim;gagement and In&sim;filtration <br />
After the initial pre&sim;set routine for the internal <br />
     con&sim;dition has been completed, <br />
the agent moves on to active intra&sim;action <br />
    with the environment, medium, and external impulses.<br />
#intra&sim;action #multiplicity #adaptation<br />
Any inter&sim;action is perceived as <br />
    an intra&sim;action – something that is in between, <br />
    creating a new system entity // rather than 2 parts<br />
When dealing with an external entity <br />
    there is always another element <br />
however, together you form a unity <br />
    common structure;<br />
the resulting assemblage is <br />
    what the agent is working with.<br />
// not “you” and “me” but “us together”<br />
￼<br />
The in&sim;tention and at&sim;tention are directed<br />
to the common mass&sim;center of the structure.<br />
Intra&sim;action <br />
The strategy of en&sim;gagement, demonstrated below, <br />
    shows what has to be done <br />
when there’s an already existing flow <br />
    coming from an external entity.<br />
<br />
[3.1] En&sim;gaging into an Existing Flow<br />
The first action that needs to be performed <br />
in order to start intra&sim;action – en&sim;gagement<br />
// en – in, gage – pledge oneself (to do something’)<br />
En&sim;gagement implies the existence of an external flow <br />
   that one can integrate into.<br />
// Surfing<br />
￼<br />
Two strategies of engagement are recommended <br />
when there’s an external impulse, <br />
which cannot be avoided<br />
to minimize the impact and to return the system to its initial state<br />
to follow the impulse and to use its force to bring the system to a new state<br />
In order to choose the right strategy, it is necessary to estimate the incoming force <br />
using experiential approach.<br />
// in order to gauge its intensity<br />
That means that any incoming impulse  <br />
is always em&sim;braced, <br />
without any opposing tension, <br />
the first seconds of acceleration <br />
   are in&sim;corporated <br />
// that can also be used in business and politics<br />
in order to estimate the force <br />
   of incoming impulse.<br />
<br />
[3.1.A] Weak Impulse => In&sim;corporation & In&sim;filtration<br />
If the incoming impulse is not considered <br />
   threatening for the structure, <br />
it is possible to in&sim;corporate it <br />
// let it enter into the bodymind <br />
and to em&sim;brace it, <br />
   using the following sequence:<br />
non&sim;tension towards incoming tension <br />
/* there is no use in responding to force with a force that is opposing */<br />
accepting direction of the incoming impulse <br />
ad&sim;justing the bodymind form&sim;structure <br />
to the incoming impulse <br />
/* for instance: creating the same momentum as the speed of incoming movement */<br />
acceptance, em&sim;brace, and absorption <br />
letting it pass through<br />
// without leaving any tension within <br />
taking it with you<br />
As a result of the action performed above <br />
   agent’s bodymind&sim;form will be slightly affected <br />
   temporarily adjusting its current state <br />
but only <br />
   to later embed itself <br />
into the common form&sim;unity<br />
   taking control of the mass-center.<br />
the agents stand opposite of each other, <br />
one pushes the other into different parts of the bodymind structure<br />
the one who is being pushed is in&sim;corporating the incoming impulses into their bodymind structure (eyes can be closed to improve experiential estimation), <br />
they do so by temporarily ad&sim;justing their body structure to accommodate the incoming impulse, and then coming back to the original state.<br />
re&sim;ceive, re&sim;adjust, re&sim;direct, respond<br />
change roles, let your partner win and lose <br />
play with the dynamics of transferring control<br />
see what happens when you resist or push stronger. test the limits.<br />
<br />
<br />
[3.1.A.1] Step 1: Redirection Sequence<br />
This sequence uses the already existing <br />
    impulses, surfaces, <br />
and slides across them, rather than against them, <br />
    to redirect the incoming flow.<br />
The following sequence can be used to activate <br />
this methodology:<br />
Move around a spac and use objects around for sudden trajectory change<br />
Same work on the floor: using the gravity and the floor contact points to create vectors of movement<br />
/* contemporary dance, butoh, noguchi taiso, gymnastica natural */<br />
Working with a partner: the agents are walking and breathing, pushing each other occasioally. Every impulse is used by every agent to redirect their movement and is transferred further to other agents.<br />
Variation: two agents are sitting: <br />
one is pushing the other, the other is adapting their bodyform, to make the pusher “fall” into their movement and desire:<br />
  1. catch the incoming impulse momentum<br />
  2. in&sim;corporate this impulse<br />
  3. accelerate the flow<br />
  // similar to how it’s done in surfing.<br />
<br />
This is how it is possible to capture <br />
    the body of the agent <br />
and to control it.<br />
Seduction   // from se- aside, ducere- lead<br />
A moment of passing control of the center<br />
// tango, wrestling, body manipulation<br />
Saying “yes, and” instead of “no, but”<br />
To agree to everything, and to then open up new spaces for weaving the thought-threads:<br />
<br />
Continue the common movement <br />
to find a new bodyformstructure<br />
Take your partner by their wrist and <br />
start controlling their motion; <br />
    change roles;<br />
         constantly change roles, <br />
take over and give up control.<br />
<br />
[3.1.A.2] Step 2: Dissipation Sequence<br />
Dissipation sequence can be initiated <br />
    if re&sim;direction control-shift dynamics <br />
has to be completed. <br />
In order to prevent the dynamics <br />
    from escalating further <br />
to bring the movement within a system <br />
    towards an end:<br />
Apply consequential contra&sim;dictory impulses<br />
    (2, 3 and more)<br />
to various points of tension <br />
    in bodyform structure.<br />
// post-truth, fake news<br />
Section [3.2] of the manual describes how to identify the points of tension that should be affected. Further sequences are provided in section [4] of the manual.<br />
<br />
[3.1.B] Mid-Force Impact: Re&sim;configuration Response<br />
Sometimes it happens that somebody says something that you simply cannot answer directly and yet it’s impossible to simply ignore it (in accordance with [3.1.A]) – maybe because we don’t like it, maybe because we cannot agree with it, but don’t want to argue.<br />
That the type of cases where sequence <br />
[3.1.B] Re&sim;configuration can be activated:<br />
estrangement, breaking the distance<br />
when an impulse enters the control zone, <br />
leave the position, <br />
<br />
free up the space<br />
<br />
move sideways backwards <br />
    to enable oneself <br />
to enter into the newly formed structure.<br />
it is also possible to fully change context<br />

[3.1.C] Strong Impact: Regeneration<br />
It may happen that the incoming impact is so strong, <br />
that it is impossible to assimilate it into one’s structure     <br />
  without breaking it. <br />
In this case, if the impact has already happened, <br />
regeneration has to be performed in order to fix things.<br />
The easiest way is to send ripple-waves <br />
through the whole structure, <br />
regenerating it with the newly found rhythms <br />
in the emptiness that ensues. <br />
// laughter<br />
To dissipate tension across the <br />
    bodymind formstructure, <br />

exhale (through the mouth)<br />
throw down all tension, <br />
send ripple waves<br />
    through the whole bodymind form&sim;structure <br />

[3.2] Creating the Flow: Initiation of En&sim;gagement<br />
Integration into an already existing structure <br />
has been loaded into memory through function [3.1]:<br />
    to support a conversation,  <br />
    to catch a wave,  <br />
    to make money on a trend, <br />
    to follow the direction of an incoming impulse <br />
            and to redirect it.<br />
However (yes, and), sometimes there are situations <br />
    when there are no perturbations in the environment <br />
no in&sim;fluences, no pro&sim;vocations, <br />
    and, therefore, no waves <br />
so then they should be created. <br />
// creativity, inventing new stuff<br />
In this case, initiate the following procedure:<br />
<br />
[3.2.A] Identification of Tension Knots<br />
Provocation<br />
/*  from Latin provocare ‘challenge’, from pro- ‘forth’ + vocare ‘to call’ */<br />
This is done through im&sim;planting a light im&sim;pulse, <br />
in order to excite the external body&sim;structure <br />
for it to reveal the tension knots  <br />
that are used to maintain its original shape.<br />
This initial impulse is made to pro&sim;voke. <br />
The external structure reveals <br />
    its strong parts and weak parts <br />
crossroads of meaning, <br />
important junctions and nodes, <br />
tensions knots <br />
// usually linked to fears - fear of in&sim;stability <br />
possibilities for further interactions. <br />
After the pattern is identified, initiate the next procedure <br />
[3.2.B] Progressive Manipulation of Tension Knots<br />
Examples:<br />
Two agents meet. One is pulling the other by the hand. The one who is pulled gives in to the movement and lets his body change the form, revealing the points of tension that emerge. <br />
To say something pleasantly-unpleasant<br />
/* called “neg” in the “game”:<br />
“you look not as tired today as usual” */<br />
Put low frequencies to the maximum<br />
To create a need, to generate a lack<br />
<br />
<br />
[3.2.B] Progressive Manipulation of Tension Knots <br />
Performed through applying a series of impulses, <br />
destined to shift the center of body&sim;structure <br />
affecting it in a subsequential way <br />
using the points of tension identified earlier.<br />
// the structure may reconfigure itself continuously.<br />
[4] Contextual Redirection of the Flow Intentionality<br />
An agent has two objectives: <br />
1. To be at ease with oneself – <br />
// com&sim;fort – from Latin “fortis” for “strong” <br />
so that others can be at ease as well. <br />
2. To explore the new states – <br />
so that it’s interesting for the others<br />
// self-development, evolution, self-realization<br />
As shown above, the flow can be redirected within a dynamic intra&sim;active system, which operates in a symmetric or complimentary feedback loop [3.1.A].<br />
The feedback loop may destroy itself, if its tendecy towards escalation is allowed take hold. <br />
Constantly shifting the roles, controlling dynamics the agent minimizes the risks and maintains stability. (remaining within the square of the context).<br />
If there is a need to change the direction of the flow, <br />
    to enter a new state <br />
then it is necessary to affect the current state <br />
    by way of a certain intentionality <br />
a clear direction, through successive impulses    <br />
    which prompt the system to leave the comfort zone and to find a new one.<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to shift a system to a new state, the current balance has to be disturbed, so that it’s easier for the system to go through changes. <br />
The current feedback loop that maintains stability can be accelerated in order to overload the system and induce a shift to a new state.<br />
Start from studing the dynamics of interaction: the agents are activating each other and transfer impulses back and forth.<br />
The resulting dybamics will be a mix of symmetric and complimentary schismogenesis. To maintain stability the agents need to respond in the way that is opposite from expected [see 3.1.A page 40). <br />
/* a feedback loop is reinforcing itself <br />
   with behavior that is expected, <br />
   leading to its imminent collapse */ <br />
E.g. In case of a symmetric loop – when an incoming impulse increases its force, do not respond with even more force (expected response), but weaken the impact to provoke the system towards de-escalation (unexpected) // losing [L]<br />
In case of a complimentary loop – when the incoming force increases, do not weaken the response, but respond with even more force // winning [W], <br />
Chaotic itinerancy is activated: LLWLWLLLWLWLLWWLLWWW. It helps the system of intra&sim;action to keep its self-destructive tendencies in check. Deescalation. <br />
The procedures above help keep the system stable. In order to shift to a new stable state, short circuit can be created. <br />
Rapid shift of coordinates <br />
// unexpected, assimetric response<br />
Increase current tendencies in order to bring the system towards controlled departure beyond its limits, provoking it to shift to a new state. <br />
/* accelerationism, exceed expectations, <br />
   involvement into a symmetric relation<br />
   and rapid shift to another level. <br />
   increasing the break. <br />
   punch in response to intention */
